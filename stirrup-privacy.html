                            I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app I
                            collect data and information (through third party products) on your phone called Log Data.
                            This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address,
                            device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my
                            Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.

                            Cookies
                            <br>
                            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique
                            identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the apps that you visit and are stored
                            on your device's internal memory.
                            <br>
                            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party
                            code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You
                            have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being
                            sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
                            portions of this Service.

                            <br>
                            I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
                            <br>
                            To facilitate our Service;
                            To provide the Service on our behalf;
                            To perform Service-related services; or
                            To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.
                            I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal
                            Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However,
                            they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
                            <br><br>
                            Security
                            <br>
                            I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving to use
                            commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission
                            over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
                            guarantee its absolute security.

                            Links to Other Sites

                            This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will
                            be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore,
                            I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these app. I have no control over
                            and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any
                            third-party sites or services.

                            These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect
                            personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a
                            child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our
                            servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us
                            with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to do necessary actions.

                            periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
                            Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this
